<h1> GOIC WordPress Engine Repository </h1>

- **Migrated Website on Subdomain**: GOIC will receive a fully operational website that has been migrated to a WordPress subdomain. This setup ensures that the site is ready for review and final adjustments before going live. Access to the subdomain will be secured with credentials, which will be shared with GOIC via secure communication channels, allowing them to directly access and manage their site. The website can be visited at https://goic.wpenginepowered.com/.
